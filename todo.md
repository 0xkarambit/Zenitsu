1. switching to the colorful logo when the user changes the theme.
2. check https://rdddeck.com/ API calls to get a direction
3. add fullscreen API support, add detail mode view, keyboard shortcuts, OAUTH and transitions, animations and text-to-speech mode !
4. adding react-form and react-fetch libraries.
5. show loading screen in Thoughts component until posts load.

# todo
