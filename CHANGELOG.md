## CHANGELOG

1. tried to add text-to-speech.
2. worked on focus mode components.
3. removed full screen mode.
4. fixed overlapping on posts in stack mode.
5. got rid of moderator messages.
6. displayMode is set after we have the data to avoid errors.
   // if we set the data before we have the data the other components try to render using the data which results in errors.
